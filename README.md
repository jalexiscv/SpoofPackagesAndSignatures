===================================

I always seemed a system of identification and verification of applications and signatures as that https://github.com/JhetoX/HowToHack85MillonDolarsCompany/tree/master/Fix for me Google always do the best job, I always ask this is really good, but if it's so good, you may be hacked or breaking ? 

Yes, everything in this world is hackable, no matter who write, as they pay for it, how many devs qualifications do they do this, or few thousand dollars cost them their study, everything is hackable, one must examine the problem and break it.

I think this is really dangerous, you can create fake applications that behave like the original, accessing tokens or keys which are validated by this kind of protection.

Really this protection sucks and is be used for large companies around the world, Google is only the tip of the iceberg.

We know what kind of idiots protect our data in the cloud:
